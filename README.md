Photovoltaic Array Fault Detection Using a Stacking Classifier Ensemble
Abstract—Photovoltaic (PV) array fault detection is essential to guaranteeing the dependability and effectiveness of solar energysystems. This work introduces an innovative defect detectiontechnique utilizing a stacking classifier that combines AdaBoost,
RandomForest, and GradientBoosting classifiers, implemented on an open-source dataset from a simulated 250-kW photovoltaic power plant. The dataset consists of 600 training cases and 50 testing instances, encompassing normal operation and three fault 
types: string fault, string-to-ground fault, and string-to-string fault, across 30 characteristics, including current, voltage, and power measurements. Our methodology utilizes feature scaling through StandardScaler and hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV, 
resulting in a testing accuracy of 93.00%, precision of 93.98%, recall of 93.00%, F1 score of 92.70%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.9457. In contrast to the previous study by Ghoneim et al. [1],  which achieved an 
AROC of 0.967 using a singular AdaBoost classifier, our ensemble approach exhibits marginally inferior AROC however provides improved robustness via model diversity. The stacking classifier demonstrates exceptional proficiency in identifying string-to-ground and 
string-to-string faults with 100% accuracy, whereas it encounters difficulties with string faults, achieving only 72% accuracy, especially in high-impedancescenarios. Feature importance study underscores the pivotal significance of the existing difference features
(Range1–Range4) in fault classification. This study enhances photovoltaic fault detection by showcasing the effectiveness of ensemble learning, establishing a basis for future improvements in renewable energy diagnostics.
